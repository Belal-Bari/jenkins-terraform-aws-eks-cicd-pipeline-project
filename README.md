# Capstone Project:

## 1. Containerizing the application and pushing to dockerhub
The first thing that starts this project is to create a Dockerfile that is used to build the image 'tanvirj9/journal-app:1.0'. <br>
`docker build -t tanvirj9/journal-app:1.0` <br>
Then this image is pushed to the public dockerhub repository <br>
`docker push tanvirj9/journal-app:1.0` <br>
The app is tested locally using the `compose.yaml` file <br>
`docker-compose -f compose.yaml up` <br>
Following curl command are used to test if the app and postgres is working properly.
1. Create a post:  
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/entries \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -d '{
      "work": "Kubernetes", 
      "struggle": "learning",
      "intention": "To build something" 
   }'

2. Get the post:
    ```bash
    curl -X GET http://loclhost:8000/entries

# If the above commands work, continue to the next step. 
   
## 2. Setting up Jenkinsfile skeleton for build, test and deploy
As for this project, jenkins is being run locally in docker containers, a tunneling service, ngrok will be setup for exposing local port (like 8080) to a public HTTPS URL.

### Setup ngrok for GitHubâ€™s webhook:
1. Install ngrok:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install snapd
   sudo snap install ngrok

The above commands are run in WSL.

2. Setup webhook in github
